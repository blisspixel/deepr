# Session Summary - October 30, 2025

## What We Fixed

### Critical Bug: Provider Mismatch in SQLite Queue
- **Problem:** Database schema missing `provider` column
- **Impact:** 6 jobs stuck in processing, status checks failing
- **Solution:** Added provider column, migration, fixed CLI commands
- **Documentation:** BUGFIX_PROVIDER_COLUMN.md

## Test Status Improvements

- **Before:** 81% pass rate (48/59 tests)
- **After:** 97% pass rate (57/59 tests)
- **Root cause:** Provider bug was causing cascading test failures

### Tests Now Passing
- File upload API tests (4 tests)
- Research modes comprehensive (2 tests)
- Provider error handling
- Anthropic provider
- Realistic research test

### Expensive API Tests
- test_cost_estimation_accuracy (5min, $0.05)
- test_grok_reasoning_comparison (10-15min, $0.25)
- These are NOT flaky - they are intentionally long-running
- Marked with @pytest.mark.expensive
- Run manually before releases

## Documentation Updates

### Roadmap Changes
- Changed status from "STABLE" to "Stabilized" (more humble)
- Removed over-confident "PRODUCTION READY" claim
- Added "Known limitations" section
- Changed "production-ready" to "Working" for features

### Known Limitations Documented
- Team mode not yet tested end-to-end
- Some TODOs remain in API routes and providers
- Azure provider needs full validation
- Cost estimation needs calibration
- Windows pipe handling issues

## Philosophy

**Tests passing != flawless system**

Tests validate what we tested, not what we didn't test.
The 97% pass rate means those specific tests work.
It doesn't mean the system is bug-free or production-ready.

## Git Commits

1. Fix critical provider mismatch bug + documentation
2. Update roadmap with bug fix
3. Update roadmap with 97% pass rate
4. Clarify expensive API tests
5. Revise roadmap to be honest and accurate

## Next Steps

1. Test team mode end-to-end
2. Address TODOs in codebase (15+ items found)
3. Fix Windows pipe handling in CLI
4. Validate Azure provider with real keys
5. Calibrate cost estimation
6. Then consider v2.4 work (MCP server, artifacts)

## Key Insight

Don't over-promise. Be honest about what works and what doesn't.
The provider bug fix was high-impact, but there's more work to do.
