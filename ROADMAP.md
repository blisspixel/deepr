# Deepr Roadmap

**Status:** This roadmap is aspirational and represents the vision for Deepr's evolution from v1.x to v3.0.

**Current Reality:** v1.x (deepr.py, manager.py) is functional but monolithic. v2.x architecture is partially complete with core abstractions in place but not yet integrated with CLI or worker processes.

This roadmap outlines planned features and architectural improvements for Deepr. The project is transitioning from a monolithic v1.x implementation to a fully modular v2.x architecture with enterprise-scale capabilities.

## Version 2.0 (Current - In Progress)

**Goal:** Complete modular architecture with local and cloud deployment options

### Core Architecture
- [x] Provider abstraction layer (OpenAI + Azure)
- [x] Storage abstraction (local filesystem + Azure Blob)
- [x] Queue system (SQLite local + Azure Service Bus stubs)
- [x] Cost estimation and control system
- [x] Configuration management with environment variables
- [x] Test infrastructure (30 passing tests, zero API costs)

### CLI and Integration
- [ ] Wire CLI to new modular components
- [ ] Implement worker process for queue processing
- [ ] Background job execution
- [ ] Job status monitoring
- [ ] Result retrieval and formatting

### API Alignment
- [ ] Full compatibility with OpenAI Deep Research API
- [ ] Background mode support with webhooks
- [ ] Prompt clarification workflow
- [ ] Prompt enrichment/rewriting
- [ ] MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
- [ ] Vector store and file search support
- [ ] Code interpreter integration
- [ ] Inline citations and annotations

### Testing
- [ ] Provider integration tests (with cheap prompts)
- [ ] Azure Service Bus integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

### Documentation
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] CLI usage guide
- [ ] Configuration reference
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

**Target:** Q2 2025
