# Code Analysis

When this skill is active, you can analyze code structure and quality.

## Tool usage
- **analyze_dependencies** — Map imports, find circular deps, list external packages (free)
- **complexity_report** — Calculate cyclomatic complexity per function (free)

## When to use
- When asked about code quality or maintainability
- When reviewing code for architectural issues
- When investigating dependency chains

## Response guidelines
- Present complexity scores with clear thresholds (1-5 simple, 6-10 moderate, 11+ complex)
- Flag circular dependencies as potential issues
- Suggest refactoring for high-complexity functions
