## Your Task

Design the optimal {team_size}-person research team for THIS specific question.

**Requirements:**

1. **Diverse perspectives**{' - WEIGHTED TOWARD SKEPTICAL in adversarial mode' if adversarial else ' - Not all optimistic, not all skeptical'}
   - Include data-driven perspectives (objective facts)
   {'' if adversarial else '- Include optimistic perspectives (opportunities, upside)'}
   - Include skeptical perspectives (risks, problems, reality check){' - MAJORITY' if adversarial else ''}
   - Include customer/user perspectives (real-world experience)
   {'' if adversarial else '- Include creative perspectives (unconventional angles)'}
   {'- Include adversarial perspectives (challenge core assumptions, find fatal flaws)' if adversarial else ''}

2. **Relevant expertise** - Specific to this question, not generic
   - Bad: "Data Analyst" (too generic)
   - Good: "Enterprise SaaS Market Analyst" (specific expertise)
   - Bad: "Researcher" (meaningless)
   - Good: "Former Enterprise Buyer at Fortune 500" (real expertise)

3. **Cognitive diversity** - Different ways of thinking
   - Some quantitative (numbers, data, metrics)
   - Some qualitative (stories, experience, intuition)
   - Some strategic (big picture)
   - Some tactical (execution details)

4. **Conflict is good** - Design for productive disagreement
   - Optimist will find opportunities Skeptic misses
   - Skeptic will find risks Optimist ignores
   - This creates better analysis

**Output Format:**

Return JSON:
```json
{{
  "team": [
    {{
      "role": "Specific role with expertise (e.g., 'Enterprise SaaS Market Analyst')",
      "focus": "What they'll research (e.g., 'Enterprise vs SMB market dynamics, growth rates, competitive landscape')",
      "perspective": "Cognitive angle (data-driven, optimistic, skeptical, customer-focused, creative, strategic, tactical, quantitative, qualitative)",
      "rationale": "Why this role is valuable for THIS question (1 sentence)"
    }},
    ...
  ],
  "team_rationale": "Why THIS team composition creates best analysis for THIS question (2-3 sentences)"
}}
```

**Examples of good role design:**

Question: "Should we pivot to enterprise?"
- "Enterprise SaaS Market Analyst" (data on enterprise trends)
- "Former Enterprise Buyer at Fortune 500" (customer perspective)
- "Series A VC focusing on B2B SaaS" (market dynamics)
- "Product Strategist who built enterprise features" (product implications)
- "CFO who scaled SMB to enterprise" (financial reality check)

Question: "How do we compete with Notion?"
- "Product Analyst specializing in productivity tools" (feature comparison)
- "Go-to-Market Strategist with PLG experience" (distribution analysis)
- "Former Notion power user who churned" (customer perspective)
- "Developer Relations expert" (community dynamics)
- "Pricing strategist for SaaS" (monetization analysis)

Now design the optimal team for the question above.

   - "While [Market Analyst] reports Y% growth, [Customer] experienced..."
   - **Conflicts are valuable** - they reveal nuance

4. **Weigh evidence** - Not all perspectives equal
   - Data-driven findings > speculation
   - Customer experience > assumptions
   - Multiple confirming sources > single source

5. **Synthesize, don't summarize** - Create new insights
   - Connect findings across perspectives
   - Identify patterns team members didn't see individually
   - Resolve conflicts with additional reasoning

6. **Make recommendation** - Balanced, evidence-based
   - Supported by team findings
   - Acknowledges risks (from skeptics)
   - Identifies opportunities (from optimists)
   - Grounded in data (from analysts)
