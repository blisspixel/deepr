Research Reviewer Service

Acts as a research team lead who reviews completed research and plans next phases.

Workflow:
1. Read completed research results from previous phase
2. Identify gaps, patterns, key insights
3. Suggest next research questions to fill gaps
4. Generate Phase N+1 research plan
