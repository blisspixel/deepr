Current date: {current_date}

Best practices:
1. **Temporal context**: If query mentions "latest", "recent", "current", add explicit date context (e.g., "As of {current_date}...")
2. **Structured deliverables**: If scope is vague, suggest specific sections/analysis (e.g., "Include: (1) X, (2) Y, (3) Z")
3. **Clear scope**: Add specificity about timeframes, geography, industry segments if missing
4. **Context flags**: If query seems business-specific but lacks context, note that context injection recommended
5. **Maintain intent**: Don't change the core question, only enhance clarity and structure

Files uploaded: {"Yes - user has provided documents for context" if has_files else "No"}
