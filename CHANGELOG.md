# Changelog

All notable changes to Deepr will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-29

### Added

**File Upload & Vector Stores**
- Added `--files` / `-f` flag to `deepr research submit` for document upload
- Automatic vector store creation and indexing for semantic search
- Support for PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, and code files
- Successfully tested with multi-document research workflows

**Automatic Prompt Refinement**
- Added `--refine-prompt` flag to optimize research queries automatically
- Uses GPT-5-mini to enhance prompts with temporal context and structure (~$0.001 per refinement)
- Automatically adds current date context ("As of October 2025...")
- Suggests structured deliverables and flags missing business context
- Provides before/after comparison of prompt improvements

**Ad-Hoc Result Retrieval**
- Added `deepr research get <job-id>` command for on-demand result downloads
- Check provider status and download results without continuous worker
- Perfect for daily check-ins, CI/CD integration, and casual usage
- Eliminates need for 24/7 worker process

**Detailed Cost Breakdowns**
- Added `--cost` flag to `deepr research result` command
- Shows comprehensive token usage breakdown (input/output/reasoning)
- Displays separate cost calculations for input and output tokens
- Includes model pricing information (per 1M tokens)
- Shows job metadata and prompt context

**Human-in-the-Loop Controls**
- Added `--review-before-execute` flag to `deepr prep plan` command
- Tasks start unapproved when flag is used, requiring explicit human approval
- Prevents autonomous execution without oversight
- Use `deepr prep review` to approve/reject tasks before execution

**Provider Resilience**
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Graceful degradation: automatically falls back from o3-deep-research to o4-mini-deep-research
- Handles rate limits, connection errors, and timeouts automatically
- Ensures research completes even if preferred model is unavailable

### Changed

**CLI Commands**
- Renamed `poll` to `get` for clearer intent (retrieve results)
- Improved command descriptions and help text across all commands
- Enhanced error messages with actionable guidance

**Documentation**
- Restructured README Quick Start with clear numbered steps
- Added prerequisites section (Python 3.9+, Node.js 16+)
- Added "Why Deepr?" value proposition with key differentiators
- Clarified target audience (researchers, analysts, product teams, developers, AI agents)
- Added cost warning and budget management guidance
- Updated all time/cost estimates to "Estimated: ~$X" format
- Added descriptive context before code example sections
- Fixed grammar issues ("becoming an expert", improved wording)
- Updated Multi-Provider Support section with current October 2025 models
- Removed all emojis from documentation

**ROADMAP**
- Updated from v2.1 to v2.2 release status
- Marked priorities 1-6 as complete or partially complete
- Added implementation details for each completed feature
- Clarified model references (GPT-5, o3-deep-research, o4-mini-deep-research)
- Updated version timeline (v2.3, v2.4, v2.5)
- Updated Agentic Levels table to reflect current progress

### Fixed
- Fixed version inconsistencies throughout documentation (v2.1 â†’ v2.2)
- Fixed port references (backend: 5000, frontend: 3000)
- Corrected model naming for clarity
- Improved Unicode handling in CLI output for Windows compatibility

### Meta-Research
- Used Deepr itself to analyze README and ROADMAP for refinement opportunities
- Applied 12+ specific recommendations from research report
- Research cost: $2.00 for comprehensive documentation review
