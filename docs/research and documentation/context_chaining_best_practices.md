# Best Practices for Multi-Step LLM Workflows

**Summarize Past Outputs:**  Large LLMs have limited context windows (e.g. GPT-3.5 ~4K tokens; GPT-4 up to 8K or even 128K) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2308.15022v3#:~:text=Large%20context%20windows%20allow%20many,spanning%20over%2020%20turns%2C%20centered)) ([metaflow.life](https://metaflow.life/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompting-and-prompt-chaining-in-ai#:~:text=%2A%20Models%20like%20GPT,Gemini%20can%20handle%20128K%E2%80%931M%20tokens)).  When chaining many calls, it’s essential to distill earlier outputs so only the most relevant information is carried forward.  A common strategy is a **running summary memory**: after each step, prompt the model to condense its own output into a brief summary or bullet list.  For example, LangChain’s `ConversationSummaryMemory` will automatically compress dialogue into one or two sentences (e.g. summarizing “user: hi / assistant: what’s up” as *“The human greets the AI, to which the AI responds.”* ([python.langchain.com](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/memory/types/summary/#:~:text=%60memory%20%3D%20ConversationSummaryMemory%28llm%3DOpenAI%28temperature%3D0%29%2C%20return_messages%3DTrue%29%20memory.save_context%28%7B,))).  In practice, you might ask the model explicitly: “Summarize the above answer in 3 key points,” or “Bullet-point the main facts from the previous output.”  This ensures subsequent prompts see a compact context.  As one guide observes, “when a workflow gets long, you’ll need to compress or summarize old info” because of token limits ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=When%20a%20workflow%20gets%20long%2C,the%20model%20does%20its%20job)).  In chat settings, practitioners even implement *sliding-window plus summary* memory: keep the most recent turns verbatim while replacing older history with an LLM-generated précis ([www.the-aideveloper.com](https://www.the-aideveloper.com/openai/module-1/memory/summarymemory/#:~:text=Summary%20memory%20solves%20this%20by,the%20best%20of%20both%20worlds)) ([www.ketelsen.ai](https://www.ketelsen.ai/ai-prompt-ideas/chunking-your-conversation-history#:~:text=Have%20you%20ever%20opened%20a,in%2C%20and%20context%20gets%20fuzzy)).  This “summary memory” approach can cut token usage by ~70% while preserving context ([www.the-aideveloper.com](https://www.the-aideveloper.com/openai/module-1/memory/summarymemory/#:~:text=Summary%20memory%20solves%20this%20by,the%20best%20of%20both%20worlds)).

**Summarization Techniques:**  Effective summaries should capture only key entities, facts, or decisions.  Common tactics include generating bullet lists, short paragraphs, or keyword tags.  For narrative outputs, one can chain multiple summarization calls (a “map-reduce” pattern): first ask the model to summarize each long section or chunk, then feed those partial summaries into another call to produce an overall summary.  OpenAI recommends piecewise recursive summarization for long documents ([nowcomment.com](https://nowcomment.com/documents/364220?scroll_to=3208903#:~:text=For%20dialogue%20applications%20that%20require,summarize%20or%20filter%20previous%20dialogue)).   In a dialogue, it’s also useful to **chain summaries**: e.g. have the LLM periodically output an updated “memory” of the conversation so far.  Recent research demonstrates this: Wang et al. “recursively generate summaries/memory using LLMs” – first prompting the model to summarize a short context, then asking it to update that summary with new turns, and finally using the latest (much shorter) summary as context for responses ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2308.15022v3#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%2C%20we%20propose,but%20also%20serves%20as%20a)) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2308.15022v3#:~:text=generated%20summaries%20are%20much%20shorter,without%20expensively%20expanding%20the%20maximum)).  This keeps the effective context small (summaries not full chat) while capturing long-term info.  Even in zero/few-shot settings this approach boosts consistency ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2308.15022v3#:~:text=subsequent%20dialogues,to%20handle%20extremely%20long%20contexts)). 

## Chaining LLM Calls

**Decompose and Sequence Tasks:**  Break complex goals into a clear sequence of sub-tasks, each with well-defined input and output ([hogonext.com](https://hogonext.com/how-to-achieve-any-llm-output/#:~:text=For%20highly%20complex%20or%20multi,the%20input%20for%20the%20next)) ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=Prompt%20chaining%20means%20linking%20prompts,or%20several%20steps%20to%20finish)).  For example: *Prompt 1* might extract facts or outline an article; *Prompt 2* uses that output to analyze or answer questions; *Prompt 3* refines or formats the final result.  One advice is: “set up prompts so each output feeds right into the next step” ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=Skip%20the%20vague%20stuff%E2%80%94ask%20direct,The%20order%20matters%2C%20too)).  Use explicit phrases or placeholders to carry results forward (e.g. “Using the above summary, …” or copying the previous answer into the new prompt).  In practice you might chain prompts like:  
- **Step 1:** “Summarize this report in 2 paragraphs.”  
- **Step 2:** “List three key themes from the above summary.”  
- **Step 3:** “Draft a conclusion based on those themes.”  
This ensures each step builds on the last.  HogoNext.com likewise counsels: **“break the task into sequential, manageable steps, with the output of one prompt serving as the input for the next.”** ([hogonext.com](https://hogonext.com/how-to-achieve-any-llm-output/#:~:text=For%20highly%20complex%20or%20multi,the%20input%20for%20the%20next)).  

**Use Structured Outputs:**  Encourage the model to produce structured data that is easy to parse in the next step.  For example, ask for a JSON list, bullet points, or numbered items.  Numbered lists and bullets often help the model “follow along” with the chain ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=Skip%20the%20vague%20stuff%E2%80%94ask%20direct,The%20order%20matters%2C%20too)).  In the LLM chain, you may use JSON or table formats for intermediate data so later prompts can easily consume them.  Many frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.) exploit this by having each call output a clearly labeled schema.  Even simple patterns like “Answer in a table” or returning key-value pairs can make chaining more reliable.  

**Iterative Refinement and Verification:**  After a multi-step chain, it’s wise to loop back sometimes.  For instance, you might follow the main chain with a final step “Review the intermediate results above and fix any errors.”  Did the LLM hallucinate or contradict earlier steps? Asking it to “show your work” or “validate the answer” can surface mistakes ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=Skip%20the%20vague%20stuff%E2%80%94ask%20direct,The%20order%20matters%2C%20too)) ([metaflow.life](https://metaflow.life/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompting-and-prompt-chaining-in-ai#:~:text=Chain,step%20problems)).  Chain-of-thought style prompts often help: explicitly prompt the model to reason step-by-step rather than jump to an answer ([metaflow.life](https://metaflow.life/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompting-and-prompt-chaining-in-ai#:~:text=Chain,step%20problems)).  You can even include self-check steps like: *“Step 4: Critique the answer you just gave and correct any mistakes.”*  This sort of self-verification is a powerful chain pattern, especially for complex tasks.  

## Managing Token Limits and Context

**Context Windows:**  Modern LLMs have fixed context lengths (e.g. GPT-4 up to 8K by default, or 32K with larger models; some research models support 128K) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2308.15022v3#:~:text=Large%20context%20windows%20allow%20many,spanning%20over%2020%20turns%2C%20centered)) ([metaflow.life](https://metaflow.life/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompting-and-prompt-chaining-in-ai#:~:text=%2A%20Models%20like%20GPT,Gemini%20can%20handle%20128K%E2%80%931M%20tokens)).  Even these large windows have limits, and throwing every prior conversation turn into the prompt leads to diminishing returns (“context dilution” ([metaflow.life](https://metaflow.life/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompting-and-prompt-chaining-in-ai#:~:text=%2A%20Trade,where%20key%20instructions%20are%20buried))).  Best practice is to keep only relevant context.  That means discarding or summarizing irrelevant chatter.  Many workflows use a *sliding window*: keep the latest N turns, and summarize or delete older ones.  For example, a “summary memory” may keep the last 5 turns verbatim and replace older history with a one- or two-sentence recap ([www.the-aideveloper.com](https://www.the-aideveloper.com/openai/module-1/memory/summarymemory/#:~:text=Summary%20memory%20solves%20this%20by,the%20best%20of%20both%20worlds)).  

**Summarization vs. Trimming:**  If even a trimmed history is too big, compress it.  Use LLM calls to shorten lengthy sections (e.g. “Summarize this paragraph in one sentence”).  A helpful tactic is to periodically ask, “What have we established so far?” and have the model recapitulate the core points.  Alternatively, store older outputs in an external knowledge store and retrieve only the top-K relevant bits for the next query (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).  But if purely in-prompt, summarization is key.  As one guideline notes, for very long dialogues it’s wise to “summarize or filter previous dialogue” rather than include it raw ([nowcomment.com](https://nowcomment.com/documents/364220?scroll_to=3208903#:~:text=For%20dialogue%20applications%20that%20require,summarize%20or%20filter%20previous%20dialogue)).  

**Cost/Performance Tradeoffs:**  Every token costs money and inference time.  If a chain is many steps, repeatedly sending the entire conversation history can be expensive.  Summarization cuts cost: for example, one illustration showed replacing 100 raw messages (10K tokens) with a growing summary plus only the last 15 messages dropped the total to ~3K tokens ([www.the-aideveloper.com](https://www.the-aideveloper.com/openai/module-1/memory/summarymemory/#:~:text=)).  That not only saves cost but often improves performance, since the model isn’t overwhelmed by irrelevant detail.  

## Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Clear Instructions & Roles:** Be explicit about each step’s role.  Use system prompts or role directives to frame the task (e.g. “You are an AI assistant summarizing news articles” or “You are a data analyst pulling facts from the summary”).  Consistent phrasing or tokens across steps can help the model carry context over.  If maintaining context manually, one can also explicitly ask the model to recall previous conversation: e.g. “Your last answer was ‘X’. Based on that answer, please do Y.”  These cues help ‘lock in’ earlier content.  

- **Format Constraints:** Require output in a precise format so it’s easy to feed into the next prompt.  Say “List 5 bullet points” or “Return JSON with fields ‘issue’ and ‘solution’.”  The more constrained, the clearer the chain.  Use headings, numbered steps, or delimiters (``` code blocks, XML tags, etc.) to separate parts of the prompt.  Explicit formatting reduces ambiguity and token bloat.  

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** For multi-step reasoning, asking the model to “think step-by-step” often yields better internal consistency ([metaflow.life](https://metaflow.life/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompting-and-prompt-chaining-in-ai#:~:text=Chain,step%20problems)).  For example, you might break a prompt into bullet points even for the model’s own reasoning process: “Step 1: Identify key factors… Step 2: Compute… Step 3: Conclude…”.  This is especially useful when chaining computations or logic over prompts.  

- **Validation and Error-Checking:** Incorporate checkpoints.  After an intermediate step, add a prompt like “Review the summary above for errors, then proceed.” or “Does anything contradict our earlier statements?”  If accuracy is crucial, have the LLM cross-check its own outputs or ask for confidence checks.  Small verification prompts can catch hallucinations early before they propagate down the chain.  

- **Reuse and Templates:** When repeating a multi-step chain, use prompt templates.  Fix boilerplate parts (intro instructions, system role, etc.) and only change inputs or examples.  This consistency helps the model “glass box” its process across runs.  Documenting each step’s expected input/output also aids debugging.  Some developers even formalize chains as structured data (e.g. a JSON list of prompt templates and dependencies) so tools or other LLMs can run the workflow programmatically ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=JSON%20Format%20for%20Prompt%20Chains)).

By combining these strategies, multi-step LLM workflows can remain coherent and efficient.  In practice, you might **loop** between summarization and reasoning: e.g. after a deep chain of thought, summarize the final reasoning, then use that distilled answer as the context for a user-facing response.  Empirical guides and research all point to the same principles: break tasks into clear steps, compress and manage context aggressively, and engineer prompts to explicitly carry information forward ([hogonext.com](https://hogonext.com/how-to-achieve-any-llm-output/#:~:text=For%20highly%20complex%20or%20multi,the%20input%20for%20the%20next)) ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=When%20a%20workflow%20gets%20long%2C,the%20model%20does%20its%20job)).  With careful design, later calls can reliably build on earlier results within the model’s token limits.

**Sources:** Best practices and example workflows are discussed in recent prompt-engineering literature and tool documentation ([hogonext.com](https://hogonext.com/how-to-achieve-any-llm-output/#:~:text=For%20highly%20complex%20or%20multi,the%20input%20for%20the%20next)) ([promptwritersai.com](https://promptwritersai.com/prompt-chaining-building-multi-step-workflows-with-llms/#:~:text=When%20a%20workflow%20gets%20long%2C,the%20model%20does%20its%20job)) ([www.the-aideveloper.com](https://www.the-aideveloper.com/openai/module-1/memory/summarymemory/#:~:text=Summary%20memory%20solves%20this%20by,the%20best%20of%20both%20worlds)) ([python.langchain.com](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/memory/types/summary/#:~:text=%60memory%20%3D%20ConversationSummaryMemory%28llm%3DOpenAI%28temperature%3D0%29%2C%20return_messages%3DTrue%29%20memory.save_context%28%7B,)) ([metaflow.life](https://metaflow.life/blog/the-complete-guide-to-prompting-and-prompt-chaining-in-ai#:~:text=Chain,step%20problems)), as well as OpenAI’s and LangChain’s guides on context management. These emphasize chaining outputs explicitly, summarizing long history, and using structured prompts to navigate token constraints.
