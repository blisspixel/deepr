## Critical Gaps

### High Priority (Blocking Production Use)

1. **Background Mode**
   - Status: Not Implemented
   - Impact: Deep research takes 10+ minutes, synchronous calls timeout
   - Required: Full async execution with job tracking
   - API: `client.responses.create(background=True, ...)`

2. **Inline Citations and Annotations**
   - Status: Not Implemented
   - Impact: Results lack credibility and traceability
   - Required: Parse and preserve annotation metadata
   - API: Access via `response.output[-1].content[0].annotations`

3. **Webhook Integration**
   - Status: Partial (v1.x only)
   - Impact: Cannot reliably receive completion notifications
   - Required: Webhook URL registration and callback handling
   - API: Configure webhook in OpenAI dashboard

4. **MCP Server Support**
   - Status: Not Implemented
   - Impact: Cannot access private/internal data
   - Required: MCP search/fetch interface implementation
   - API: `{"type": "mcp", "server_url": "...", "require_approval": "never"}`

### Medium Priority (Feature Completeness)

5. **Vector Store / File Search**
   - Status: Not Implemented
   - Impact: Cannot search over uploaded documents
   - Required: Vector store management and file search tool
   - API: `{"type": "file_search", "vector_store_ids": [...]}`

6. **Clarification Workflow**
   - Status: Partial
   - Impact: Suboptimal prompts lead to poor results
   - Required: Structured clarification + prompt rewriting
   - API: Multi-turn conversation with gpt-4.1 before research

7. **Tool Call Transparency**
   - Status: Not Implemented
   - Impact: Users cannot see what searches were performed
   - Required: Parse and display intermediate steps
   - API: Iterate `response.output` for web_search_call items

8. **Cost Control**
   - Status: Partial (estimation only)
   - Impact: Cannot limit actual tool calls
   - Required: max_tool_calls parameter support
   - API: `client.responses.create(max_tool_calls=50, ...)`

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

9. **Reasoning Summaries**
   - Status: Not Implemented
   - Impact: Limited insight into research process
   - API: `reasoning={"summary": "auto"}` or `"detailed"`

10. **Code Interpreter Tracking**
    - Status: Not Implemented
    - Impact: Cannot see analysis/charts generated
    - API: Parse `code_interpreter_call` items

11. **Safety Monitoring**
    - Status: Not Implemented
    - Impact: No protection against prompt injection
    - Required: LLM-based monitor for suspicious tool calls

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (v2.0)

```python
# Example: Background mode with webhook
response = client.responses.create(
    model="o3-deep-research-2025-06-26",
    input=[
        {"role": "developer", "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": system_message}]},
        {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "input_text", "text": user_query}]}
    ],
    background=True,  # ‚Üê CRITICAL
    reasoning={"summary": "auto"},
    tools=[
        {"type": "web_search_preview"},
        {"type": "code_interpreter", "container": {"type": "auto"}}
    ]
)

# Response contains job_id, poll for status or receive webhook
```

### Phase 2: Data Access (v2.1)

```python
# Example: MCP for internal documents
tools=[
    {"type": "web_search_preview"},
    {
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "internal_docs",
        "server_url": "https://your-mcp-server.com/sse",
        "require_approval": "never"
    }
]
```

### Phase 3: Citations and Transparency (v2.1)

```python
# Example: Parse citations
annotations = response.output[-1].content[0].annotations
for citation in annotations:
    print(f"[{citation.start_index}:{citation.end_index}] {citation.title}")
    print(f"  URL: {citation.url}")
```

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (v2.2+)

- Vector store management
- Clarification agent pipeline
- Tool call monitoring
- Safety filters
