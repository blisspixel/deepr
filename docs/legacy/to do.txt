Error retrieving final output: 'MockValSer' object cannot be converted to 'SchemaSerializer'

To run this same task directly next time, use:
python deepr.py --research "Please ...."



Right. So when that happens, I have the manager which can download it.  Maybe if we get "Error retrieving final output: 'MockValSer' object cannot be converted to 'SchemaSerializer'" -> we in 1 minute try to get the report the same way the manager does?  ... since the report is there... I think maybe it wasn't ready yet.  Or just try again in 3 minutes if get that error?

Also... use the 40 page Edward jones file to refine the style.py.
