# Test Improvements Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Tests (Good Coverage)
1. Unit tests: 47/47 passing (costs, queue, storage, providers)
2. Integration tests: 5/5 passing (minimal, realistic, file upload, prompt refinement, cost estimation)
3. Campaign test: Added but not run with real API yet

### Problem: Trivial Test Prompts

Current real API tests use trivial prompts that provide no value:
- "What is 2+2?" - Wastes money on arithmetic
- "What are the top 3 programming languages?" - Generic info we already know

**Opportunity:** Since these tests cost money anyway, ask questions that actually help improve Deepr!

## Missing Test Coverage

### 1. Team Research (Dream Team)
**Status:** Not tested with real API
**Priority:** High
**Value:** Validates Six Thinking Hats methodology
**Test:** Ask strategic question about Deepr's roadmap
**Estimated Cost:** $0.60 (6 perspectives x $0.10)

### 2. Error Handling
**Status:** No real API tests for errors
**Priority:** Medium
**Coverage Needed:**
- Invalid API keys
- Rate limiting
- Malformed prompts
- Network errors
- Provider timeouts

### 3. Large File Upload
**Status:** Only tests small files
**Priority:** Medium
**Test:** Upload 50+ page PDF and search it
**Estimated Cost:** $0.15

### 4. Long-Running Research
**Status:** Campaign test validates this
**Priority:** Low (already covered)

### 5. Concurrent Job Execution
**Status:** Not tested
**Priority:** Low
**Test:** Submit 5 jobs simultaneously, verify all complete
**Estimated Cost:** $0.50

## Improved Test Prompts (Dogfooding)

Instead of trivial prompts, ask questions that help improve Deepr:

### Test 1: Minimal Research (replaces "What is 2+2?")
**New Prompt:**
"As of October 2025, what are the latest best practices for CLI design in developer tools? Include examples from successful tools (git, docker, kubectl) and key principles for intuitive command structure. Keep under 300 words."

**Value:**
- Validates quick research works
- Gets actionable insights for our CLI
- Cost: ~$0.02

### Test 2: Realistic Research (replaces "top 3 programming languages")
**New Prompt:**
"As of October 2025, what are the state-of-the-art techniques for agentic research using deep research APIs and LLMs? Include: (1) Multi-agent orchestration patterns, (2) Context management strategies, (3) Quality assessment methods, (4) Cost optimization techniques. Cite specific tools, papers, or implementations."

**Value:**
- Validates realistic research
- Learns about latest agentic research patterns
- Could inform our roadmap
- Cost: ~$0.11

### Test 3: File Upload (keep similar but better prompt)
**New Prompt:**
"Based on the README and ROADMAP documents uploaded, identify: (1) Top 3 features most likely to attract users, (2) Potential usability issues, (3) Missing documentation sections, (4) Competitive advantages to emphasize. Provide specific recommendations."

**Value:**
- Validates file upload + semantic search
- Gets external analysis of our docs
- Cost: ~$0.02

### Test 4: Prompt Refinement (keep similar)
**Current:** "research AI code editors"
**Keep this** - validates refinement adds value

### Test 5: Campaign Test (improve prompt)
**New Phase 1:**
"Document the current state of research automation tools and deep research APIs as of October 2025. Include: product names, capabilities, pricing, API features, use cases, and adoption signals. Focus on tools for agentic research, multi-step reasoning, and knowledge synthesis."

**New Phase 2:**
"Using the inventory from Phase 1, analyze: (1) Key trends in research automation, (2) Gaps in current offerings, (3) Opportunities for differentiation, (4) Strategic recommendations for positioning Deepr. Include specific feature suggestions and go-to-market insights."

**Value:**
- Validates campaign context chaining
- Competitive intelligence for Deepr
- Strategic insights for roadmap
- Cost: ~$0.33

### Test 6: NEW - Team Research
**Prompt:**
"Should Deepr prioritize Google Gemini integration or web content extraction as the next major feature? Consider: technical complexity, user demand, competitive advantage, development time, and strategic value."

**Value:**
- Validates dream team methodology
- Gets multi-perspective analysis on real roadmap decision
- Cost: ~$0.60 (6 perspectives)

### Test 7: NEW - Cost Estimation Accuracy
**Prompt:**
"Research the current landscape of AI-powered development tools focused on code generation and assistance. Include top 10 tools, their features, pricing, and market positioning as of October 2025."

**Value:**
- Validates cost tracking
- Market intelligence
- Cost: ~$0.05

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Update Existing Tests (No new costs)
1. Update test_minimal_research_o4_mini prompt (CLI best practices)
2. Update test_realistic_research_o4_mini prompt (agentic research techniques)
3. Update test_file_upload_and_search prompt (analyze our docs)
4. Update test_campaign_context_chaining prompts (competitive intelligence)

**Total Additional Value:** High-quality research insights worth $50-100
**Additional Cost:** $0 (already running these tests)

### Phase 2: Add New Tests
1. test_team_research (dream team validation)
2. test_large_file_upload (50+ page PDF)
3. test_concurrent_execution (stress test)

**Total Cost:** ~$1.25
**Value:** Critical coverage gaps filled + useful research

### Phase 3: Error Handling Tests
1. test_invalid_api_key
2. test_rate_limiting_handling
3. test_malformed_prompt_recovery
4. test_network_timeout_retry

**Total Cost:** ~$0 (these should fail fast)
**Value:** Production reliability

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
1. Same test costs, 10x more value from results
2. Actionable insights for Deepr roadmap
3. Competitive intelligence
4. External validation of our docs

### Long-term Benefits
1. Dogfooding culture (use Deepr to improve Deepr)
2. Test suite becomes research asset
3. Continuous competitive monitoring
4. Real-world validation of all features

## Metrics to Track

### Test Quality Metrics
- Actionability: % of test results that informed roadmap decisions
- Research Value: Estimated manual research cost equivalent
- Feature Coverage: % of major features tested with real API
- Insight Generation: Number of roadmap ideas generated from tests

### Current Baseline
- Real API tests: 6 tests
- Actual research value: ~$0 (trivial prompts)
- Features tested: Single research, file upload, prompt refinement, campaigns
- Insights generated: 0

### Target After Improvements
- Real API tests: 10 tests
- Research value: ~$100-150 (useful insights)
- Features tested: Add team research, concurrent execution, large files
- Insights generated: 5-10 actionable ideas per test run

## Next Steps

1. Update existing test prompts (test_real_api.py)
2. Run tests and capture insights
3. Document findings in TEST_INSIGHTS.md
4. Add new tests (team, large files, concurrent)
5. Create automated insight extraction process

## Budget Consideration

Current monthly test cost: ~$0.50 (run existing tests once)
Proposed monthly test cost: ~$2.00 (run all tests including new ones)
Research value extracted: ~$150-200 (if purchased manually)

ROI: 75-100x return on test spend
