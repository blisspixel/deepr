# Deepr v2.3 Release Notes

Release Date: October 29, 2025

## Overview

Deepr v2.3 focuses on production readiness, developer experience, and operational excellence. This release completes critical infrastructure for persistent vector stores, campaign management, cost tracking, and configuration management, while adding a professional build and installation system.

## What's New

### Persistent Vector Store Management

Create reusable document indexes that persist across research jobs:

```bash
# Create persistent vector store
deepr vector create --name "company-docs" --files docs/*.pdf

# List all vector stores
deepr vector list

# Use in research
deepr research submit "Query based on docs" --vector-store company-docs --yes

# Manage stores
deepr vector info vs_abc123
deepr vector delete vs_abc123
```

**Benefits:**
- Index documents once, use across multiple research jobs
- Significant cost savings for repeated document-based research
- Organized knowledge management

### Campaign Pause/Resume Controls

Mid-campaign intervention for human oversight:

```bash
# Pause active campaign
deepr prep pause

# Resume when ready
deepr prep resume

# Execution automatically checks pause status
```

**Use cases:**
- Review interim results before continuing
- Adjust strategy mid-campaign
- Budget control and oversight

### Always-On Prompt Refinement

Automatically optimize all research queries:

```bash
# Enable in .env
DEEPR_AUTO_REFINE=true

# Now all submissions automatically get optimized
deepr research submit "Your query" --yes
```

**What it adds:**
- Temporal context (As of October 2025...)
- Structured deliverables
- Scope clarification
- Best practices enforcement

### Batch Operations

Efficient management of multiple jobs:

```bash
# Download all completed jobs
deepr research get --all

# Sync all job statuses with provider
deepr queue sync
```

### Enhanced Cost Management

Better visibility into spending:

```bash
# Cost summary by time period
deepr cost summary --period today
deepr cost summary --period week
deepr cost summary --period month

# Shows:
# - Total spending and breakdown
# - Cost by model
# - Budget percentage used
# - Average per job
```

### Research Export

Export results in multiple formats:

```bash
# Export to different formats
deepr research export abc123 --format markdown
deepr research export abc123 --format json
deepr research export abc123 --format html --output report.html
```

### Configuration Management

Validate and manage configuration easily:

```bash
# Validate config and test API
deepr config validate

# Show current settings
deepr config show

# Update configuration
deepr config set DEEPR_AUTO_REFINE true
```

### Professional Build System

Simple installation on all platforms:

```bash
# Universal install
pip install .

# Platform-specific installers
./install.sh        # Linux/macOS
install.bat         # Windows

# Verify
deepr --version
```

**Added files:**
- `pyproject.toml` - Modern Python packaging
- `INSTALL.md` - Platform-specific instructions
- `install.sh` / `install.bat` - One-command installation
- `Makefile` - Development tasks
- `build.bat` - Windows build

## Complete Feature List

### v2.3 Features

**Core Functionality:**
1. Persistent vector store management (create, list, info, delete)
2. Campaign pause/resume controls
3. Always-on prompt refinement (DEEPR_AUTO_REFINE)
4. Batch job download (--all flag)
5. Queue sync command
6. Enhanced cost management (time periods, model breakdown)
7. Research export (markdown, txt, json, html)
8. Configuration management (validate, show, set)
9. Usage analytics and insights
10. Failure pattern analysis
11. Prompt templates with placeholders

**Developer Experience:**
12. Modern Python packaging (pyproject.toml)
13. Platform-specific installers
14. Global `deepr` command
15. Comprehensive documentation (INSTALL.md, FEATURES.md)
16. Build automation (Makefile, build.bat)

### Carried from v2.2

- File upload with vector stores
- Automatic prompt refinement (--refine-prompt)
- Ad-hoc result retrieval (get command)
- Detailed cost breakdowns (--cost flag)
- Human-in-the-loop controls (--review-before-execute)
- Provider resilience (auto-retry, graceful degradation)

## Installation

### New Install

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepr.git
cd deepr

# Run installer (Linux/macOS)
./install.sh

# Or Windows
install.bat

# Or manual
pip install .
```

### Upgrade from v2.2

```bash
cd deepr
git pull
pip install --upgrade .
```

## Breaking Changes

None. v2.3 is fully backward compatible with v2.2.

## Migration Guide

### Enabling New Features

**1. Always-on refinement:**
```bash
# Add to .env
DEEPR_AUTO_REFINE=true
```

**2. Persistent vector stores:**
```bash
# Migrate existing one-time uploads to persistent stores
deepr vector create --name "existing-docs" --files docs/*.pdf
```

**3. Configuration management:**
```bash
# Validate your current setup
deepr config validate
```

## Known Issues

- Job lookup in wait/get commands may fail with shortened IDs (use full UUID)
- Vector store creation requires files to be fully indexed before research submission
- Configuration set command requires manual service restart

## Performance

No significant performance changes. Vector store reuse improves cost efficiency for document-based research.
