Learn how to make your first ElevenLabs API request.
The ElevenLabs API provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art audio models and features. Follow this guide to learn how to create lifelike speech with our Text to Speech API. See the developer guides for more examples with our other products.

Using the Text to Speech API
1
Create an API key
Create an API key in the dashboard here, which you’ll use to securely access the API.

Store the key as a managed secret and pass it to the SDKs either as a environment variable via an .env file, or directly in your app’s configuration depending on your preference.

.env


ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<your_api_key_here>
2
Install the SDK
We’ll also use the dotenv library to load our API key from an environment variable.


Python

TypeScript


pip install elevenlabs
pip install python-dotenv
To play the audio through your speakers, you may be prompted to install MPV and/or ffmpeg.

3
Make your first request
Create a new file named example.py or example.mts, depending on your language of choice and add the following code:


Python

TypeScript


from dotenv import load_dotenv
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
from elevenlabs.play import play
import os
load_dotenv()
elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
  api_key=os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY"),
)
audio = elevenlabs.text_to_speech.convert(
    text="The first move is what sets everything in motion.",
    voice_id="JBFqnCBsd6RMkjVDRZzb",
    model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
    output_format="mp3_44100_128",
)
play(audio)
4
Run the code

Python

TypeScript


python example.py
You should hear the audio play through your speakers.

Streaming text to speech

Copy page

Learn how to stream text into speech in Python or Node.js.
In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to convert text to speech with the ElevenLabs SDK. We’ll start by talking through how to generate speech and receive a file and then how to generate speech and stream the response back. Finally, as a bonus we’ll show you how to upload the generated audio to an AWS S3 bucket, and share it through a signed URL. This signed URL will provide temporary access to the audio file, making it perfect for sharing with users by SMS or embedding into an application.

If you want to jump straight to an example you can find them in the Python and Node.js example repositories.

Requirements
An ElevenLabs account with an API key (here’s how to find your API key).
Python or Node installed on your machine
(Optionally) an AWS account with access to S3.
Setup
Installing our SDK
Before you begin, make sure you have installed the necessary SDKs and libraries. You will need the ElevenLabs SDK for the text to speech conversion. You can install it using pip:


Python

TypeScript


pip install elevenlabs
Additionally, install necessary packages to manage your environmental variables:


Python

TypeScript


pip install python-dotenv
Next, create a .env file in your project directory and fill it with your credentials like so:

.env


ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
Convert text to speech (file)
To convert text to speech and save it as a file, we’ll use the convert method of the ElevenLabs SDK and then it locally as a .mp3 file.


Python

TypeScript


import os
import uuid
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from elevenlabs import VoiceSettings
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
load_dotenv()
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")
elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
    api_key=ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
)
def text_to_speech_file(text: str) -> str:
    # Calling the text_to_speech conversion API with detailed parameters
    response = elevenlabs.text_to_speech.convert(
        voice_id="pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB", # Adam pre-made voice
        output_format="mp3_22050_32",
        text=text,
        model_id="eleven_turbo_v2_5", # use the turbo model for low latency
        # Optional voice settings that allow you to customize the output
        voice_settings=VoiceSettings(
            stability=0.0,
            similarity_boost=1.0,
            style=0.0,
            use_speaker_boost=True,
            speed=1.0,
        ),
    )
    # uncomment the line below to play the audio back
    # play(response)
    # Generating a unique file name for the output MP3 file
    save_file_path = f"{uuid.uuid4()}.mp3"
    # Writing the audio to a file
    with open(save_file_path, "wb") as f:
        for chunk in response:
            if chunk:
                f.write(chunk)
    print(f"{save_file_path}: A new audio file was saved successfully!")
    # Return the path of the saved audio file
    return save_file_path
You can then run this function with:


Python

TypeScript


text_to_speech_file("Hello World")
Convert text to speech (streaming)
If you prefer to stream the audio directly without saving it to a file, you can use our streaming feature.


Python

TypeScript


import os
from typing import IO
from io import BytesIO
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from elevenlabs import VoiceSettings
from elevenlabs.client import ElevenLabs
load_dotenv()
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = os.getenv("ELEVENLABS_API_KEY")
elevenlabs = ElevenLabs(
    api_key=ELEVENLABS_API_KEY,
)
def text_to_speech_stream(text: str) -> IO[bytes]:
    # Perform the text-to-speech conversion
    response = elevenlabs.text_to_speech.stream(
        voice_id="pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB", # Adam pre-made voice
        output_format="mp3_22050_32",
        text=text,
        model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",
        # Optional voice settings that allow you to customize the output
        voice_settings=VoiceSettings(
            stability=0.0,
            similarity_boost=1.0,
            style=0.0,
            use_speaker_boost=True,
            speed=1.0,
        ),
    )
    # Create a BytesIO object to hold the audio data in memory
    audio_stream = BytesIO()
    # Write each chunk of audio data to the stream
    for chunk in response:
        if chunk:
            audio_stream.write(chunk)
    # Reset stream position to the beginning
    audio_stream.seek(0)
    # Return the stream for further use
    return audio_stream
You can then run this function with:


Python

TypeScript


text_to_speech_stream("This is James")
Bonus - Uploading to AWS S3 and getting a secure sharing link
Once your audio data is created as either a file or a stream you might want to share this with your users. One way to do this is to upload it to an AWS S3 bucket and generate a secure sharing link.

Creating your AWS credentials
Installing the AWS SDK and adding the credentials
Uploading to AWS S3 and generating the signed URL
Putting it all together
Conclusion
You now know how to convert text into speech and generate a signed URL to share the audio file. This functionality opens up numerous opportunities for creating and sharing content dynamically.

Here are some examples of what you could build with this.

Educational Podcasts: Create personalized educational content that can be accessed by students on demand. Teachers can convert their lessons into audio format, upload them to S3, and share the links with students for a more engaging learning experience outside the traditional classroom setting.

Accessibility Features for Websites: Enhance website accessibility by offering text content in audio format. This can make information on websites more accessible to individuals with visual impairments or those who prefer auditory learning.

Automated Customer Support Messages: Produce automated and personalized audio messages for customer support, such as FAQs or order updates. This can provide a more engaging customer experience compared to traditional text emails.

Audio Books and Narration: Convert entire books or short stories into audio format, offering a new way for audiences to enjoy literature. Authors and publishers can diversify their content offerings and reach audiences who prefer listening over reading.

Language Learning Tools: Develop language learning aids that provide learners with audio lessons and exercises. This makes it possible to practice pronunciation and listening skills in a targeted way.
