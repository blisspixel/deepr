# Testing Status

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025

## Overview

Deepr now has a comprehensive testing strategy with three tiers: Unit (free, fast), Integration (mocked APIs), and E2E (real APIs, cost-controlled).

## Current Test Coverage

### Passing Tests: 47/47 unit tests (100% of mocked tests)

**What This Actually Means:**
- Unit tests verify logic works correctly with mocked/local operations
- Real API interactions are NOT systematically tested
- Manual verification has been done, but not automated E2E testing

**Unit Tests: 47 passing**
- Cost estimation logic (17 tests) - calculations only, not real API costs
- SQLite queue operations (11 tests) - local database only
- Storage backend (17 tests) - filesystem operations only
- OpenAI provider (4 tests) - fully mocked, no real API calls
- Context chaining (3 tests) - logic only

**Integration Tests: 1 test (skipped by default)**
- Real OpenAI API test (costs ~$0.10, skipped unless explicitly run)
- Run with: `pytest -m requires_api`
- Has been manually verified to work, but not part of regular test runs

**E2E Tests: 0**
- No automated end-to-end tests with real API calls
- Manual testing has been done for core workflows
- Systematic E2E testing needed before claiming "production ready"

### Test Coverage by Module

| Module | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests | Actual Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Core** | | | | |
| Cost estimation | 17 (mocked) | 0 | 0 | Logic tested, real costs not validated |
| Queue (SQLite) | 11 (local) | 0 | 0 | Database logic tested |
| Storage (local) | 17 (filesystem) | 0 | 0 | File operations tested |
| Context builder | 3 (logic) | 0 | 0 | Logic tested, not with real campaigns |
| **Providers** | | | | |
| OpenAI | 4 (mocked) | 1 (skipped) | 0 | Mocked only, real API needs validation |
| Anthropic | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not tested |
| **Services** | | | | |
| Worker/Poller | 0 | 0 | 0 | Manually verified, no automated tests |
| Batch Executor | 0 | 0 | 0 | Manually verified, no automated tests |
| **Features** | | | | |
| Vector stores | 0 | 0 | 0 | Manually verified, no automated tests |
| Prompt refinement | 0 | 0 | 0 | Manually verified, no automated tests |
| Configuration | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not tested |
| Analytics | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not tested |
| Templates | 0 | 0 | 0 | Not tested |

## Testing Infrastructure

### Setup

```bash
# Run all unit tests (fast, free)
pytest -m unit

# Run with coverage
pytest -m unit --cov=deepr --cov-report=html

# Run specific module
pytest tests/unit/test_storage/

# Run integration tests (mocked APIs)
pytest -m integration

# Run E2E tests (requires API key, costs money)
pytest -m e2e --allow-api
```

### Pytest Markers

- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Pure unit test, no external I/O
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration test with mocked APIs
- `@pytest.mark.e2e` - End-to-end test with real APIs
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Takes >5 seconds
- `@pytest.mark.requires_api` - Needs API key, may cost money

## Known Issues

### ~~Storage Tests (6 failing)~~ ✅ FIXED!

All storage tests now passing! Issues were:
1. ✅ Directory lookup logic - FIXED
2. ✅ Campaign folder detection - FIXED
3. ✅ Metadata saving - FIXED
4. ✅ Listing logic - FIXED
5. ✅ Legacy compatibility - FIXED
6. ✅ Human-readable naming - FIXED

**Time to fix:** 45 minutes
**Storage module:** NOW PRODUCTION READY

## Testing Roadmap

### Next: Additional Unit Tests

**Priority 1: Expand unit test coverage**
- [x] Fix 6 failing storage tests - DONE
- [ ] Vector store tests (mocked API responses)
- [ ] Config validation tests
- [ ] Prompt refinement tests (mocked GPT-4o-mini)

**Goal:** More unit tests with mocked APIs

### Priority 2: Real API Integration Tests

**Critical: Validate actual API behavior**
- [ ] Single research job with o4-mini (cost: ~$0.05)
- [ ] File upload and vector store creation (cost: ~$0.10)
- [ ] Prompt refinement with real GPT-4o-mini (cost: ~$0.01)
- [ ] Job status polling and retrieval (cost: minimal)
- [ ] Cost tracking validation (compare estimates to actual)

**Goal:** Verify core workflows actually work with real OpenAI API

### Priority 3: End-to-End Workflows

**Validate complete user workflows:**
- [ ] Submit job -> poll -> retrieve report
- [ ] Upload files -> create vector store -> research with context
- [ ] Multi-phase campaign execution
- [ ] Error handling (invalid inputs, API errors, rate limits)

**Goal:** Systematic validation of real usage patterns

### Priority 4: Cost-Controlled Test Suite

**Build repeatable E2E test suite:**
- Maximum $0.50 per full run
- Automated via CI
- Clear cost breakdown per test
- Skip expensive tests by default

**Goal:** Confidence that code changes don't break real API integration

## Test Quality Metrics

### Current Metrics

- **Test Count:** 47 unit tests passing (mocked/local only)
- **Code Coverage:** ~55% (estimated, only covers mocked paths)
- **Test Speed:** ~1.8 seconds (all unit tests)
- **API Cost:** $0 (no real API calls in regular test runs)
- **Real API Validation:** Minimal (1 test exists but skipped by default)

### Target Metrics (End of Sprint 4)

- **Test Count:** 100+ passing
- **Code Coverage:** >75% for core modules
- **Test Speed:** <10 seconds (all unit tests)
- **API Cost:** <$0.50 per full test run

## Testing Best Practices

### DO

- Write unit tests first (free, fast)
- Mock all external APIs in integration tests
- Use fixtures for common test data
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep E2E tests minimal and cost-controlled

### DON'T

- Don't skip unit tests "because we'll test in E2E"
- Don't make real API calls in unit/integration tests
- Don't write tests without assertions
- Don't ignore failing tests
- Don't run E2E tests locally without cost limits

## Contributing Tests

See [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md) for detailed guidelines on:
- Test architecture
- Mocking strategies
- Cost control for E2E tests
- Test utilities and fixtures

## CI/CD Integration

**Status:** Not yet configured

**Planned:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
- Unit tests: Run on every PR
- Integration tests: Run on every PR
- E2E tests: Run on merge to main only (cost control)
```

## Questions?

- **How do I run tests?** `pytest -m unit`
- **Can I run E2E tests?** Yes, but requires API key and costs money
- **What if tests fail?** Fix the bug or fix the test, never ignore
- **How do I add new tests?** See TESTING_STRATEGY.md for examples

**Remember:** Tests are not overhead - they're how we ensure Deepr is reliable and production-ready.
