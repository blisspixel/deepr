## What's Actually Been Tested

### Tested Through Real Usage

**File Upload (OpenAI):**
- ✅ Single file upload
- ✅ Vector store creation
- ✅ Ingestion monitoring
- ✅ File search tool integration
- ❌ Multiple files at once
- ❌ Large files (> 100MB)
- ❌ Binary file types (PDF, DOCX)
- ❌ Error handling for failed uploads

**File Upload (Gemini):**
- ✅ .txt file upload
- ✅ .md file upload
- ✅ MIME type detection
- ❌ PDF, DOCX, code files
- ❌ Large files
- ❌ Error handling

**Job Status Retrieval:**
- ✅ Basic status check (1 job tested)
- ✅ Provider API query (confirmed with research-2dd)
- ✅ Elapsed time display
- ❌ Failed jobs
- ❌ Expired jobs
- ❌ Cancelled jobs
- ❌ Multiple concurrent jobs

**OpenAI Provider:**
- ✅ Basic submission (with web search)
- ✅ File upload with vector store
- ✅ Tool configuration (post-bug-fix)
- ❌ Code interpreter tool
- ❌ Rate limit handling
- ❌ Retry logic
- ❌ Fallback models
- ❌ Azure OpenAI

**Gemini Provider:**
- ✅ Basic submission
- ✅ File upload
- ✅ Synchronous execution
- ❌ Thinking models behavior
- ❌ Google Search grounding
- ❌ Error handling
- ❌ Rate limits

### Not Tested At All

**Providers:**
- ❌ Azure OpenAI (zero real-world testing)
- ❌ xAI Grok (in development)

**Features:**
- ❌ Multi-phase projects (`deepr run project`)
- ❌ Team research (`deepr run team`)
- ❌ Documentation mode (`deepr run docs`)
- ❌ Budget enforcement
- ❌ Cost tracking accuracy
- ❌ Vector store cleanup at scale
- ❌ Job cancellation
- ❌ Worker process (background job processing)
- ❌ Webhook callbacks
- ❌ Metadata handling

**Edge Cases:**
- ❌ Network failures mid-request
- ❌ Disk full conditions
- ❌ Corrupted database
- ❌ Concurrent job submissions
- ❌ Very long prompts
- ❌ Unicode/emoji in prompts
- ❌ File paths with spaces (added to docs, not tested)

**Provider Resilience:**
- ❌ Rate limit retry logic
- ❌ Connection timeout handling
- ❌ Graceful degradation
- ❌ Fallback model switching
- ❌ Partial response handling

## Known Issues From This Session

**Fixed But Minimally Validated:**
1. Job status retrieval bugs - Fixed but only tested with 1-2 jobs
2. OpenAI tool configuration - Fixed but not tested with all tool combinations
3. Elapsed time tracking - Just implemented, minimal validation

**Discovered Through Usage:**
- Deep research jobs can run 60+ minutes (normal, but no timeout logic)
- Local DB can show stale status (now checks provider, but no automatic sync)
- File upload errors not gracefully handled

## What We Actually Know

**Confidence Levels:**

**High Confidence (tested multiple times):**
- OpenAI basic submission with web search
- Gemini basic submission
- File upload basics (OpenAI vector stores, Gemini .txt/.md)

**Medium Confidence (tested once or twice):**
- Job status retrieval
- Provider API sync
- Cost tracking

**Low Confidence (minimal or no testing):**
- Multi-provider switching
- Error recovery
- Rate limit handling
- Azure OpenAI
- Multi-phase projects
- Team research
- Budget enforcement

**No Confidence (not tested):**
- xAI Grok
- Worker background processing
- Concurrent operations
- Edge cases
- Provider resilience under failures

## Honest Assessment

**Current State:** Early development with basic functionality working for happy path scenarios.

**What Works:** Simple research jobs with OpenAI and Gemini, basic file upload, basic status checking.

**What's Unclear:** Everything else. Most features exist in code but haven't been validated through real-world usage.

**Risk Areas:**
- Provider error handling
- Concurrent operations
- Long-running job management
- Resource cleanup
- Cost tracking accuracy

## Testing Priorities

Based on what we learned from bug discoveries:

1. **Integration Testing** - End-to-end flows with real APIs
2. **Error Scenario Testing** - Network failures, rate limits, API errors
3. **Concurrent Operations** - Multiple jobs, race conditions
4. **Provider Validation** - Test each provider thoroughly
5. **Edge Cases** - File paths with spaces, large files, unicode
6. **Resource Management** - Vector store cleanup, disk space, memory
7. **Cost Accuracy** - Validate cost calculations match actual bills

## Conclusion

We've fixed 8 bugs discovered through real usage. That's progress. But claiming "production-ready" would be dishonest. We have basic functionality working for simple use cases. Everything else needs systematic testing.

The self-improvement loop works - using Deepr revealed bugs. But we need much more dogfooding to find the remaining issues.
