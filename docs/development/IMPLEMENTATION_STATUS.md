## Known Issues & Considerations

### 1. PDF Generation
- `docx2pdf` requires MS Word on Windows
- Consider alternative: `pypandoc` or `weasyprint`
- May need conditional PDF generation

### 2. Async Throughout
- New architecture is fully async
- CLI needs proper async/await handling
- May need `asyncio.run()` wrapper for CLI commands

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Old `deepr.py` and `manager.py` preserved in root
- Need clear deprecation timeline
- Consider symlinks or wrapper scripts

### 4. Azure Managed Identity
- Implementation placeholder exists
- Needs proper testing in Azure environment
- Token refresh logic needed

### 5. Vector Store Cleanup
- Currently tracked per-job
- Need robust error handling
- Consider background cleanup job

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Mock provider responses
- Test storage backends with temp directories
- Test configuration loading
- Test report formatting

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end research submission
- Multi-provider compatibility
- Storage backend switching
- Webhook handling

### Manual Testing
- Local development with ngrok
- Azure deployment validation
- Cost tracking accuracy
- Performance under load
